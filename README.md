# JavaScript_ToDo_List_Using_LocalStorage

I am uploading all my projects from last year. Things will get real hot soon.
A simple JavaScript To-Do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application uses LocalStorage of browser to store user data even after the browser is closed. 

Functionality: 
Task Input and Filters: Users can input tasks in the provided input field. The tasks are categorized using filter buttons, such as "All", "Completed", and "Pending".

Displaying Tasks: The tasks are displayed dynamically based on the selected filter. Completed tasks are shown with a checked checkbox and a strikethrough effect.

Editing and Deleting Tasks: Users can edit tasks by clicking on the "Edit" button, which populates the task input field with the selected task's text. Tasks can be deleted by clicking on the "Delete" button.

Updating Task Status: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task. The task's status is updated accordingly in the LocalStorage.

Clear All Tasks: The "Clear All" button allows users to delete all tasks from the list.

Overall, this To-Do list application provides a straightforward and efficient way for users to manage their tasks, with the added convenience of data persistence through LocalStorage.
